# 📊 Diwali Sales Data Analysis

This project is a data analysis of sales during Diwali using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. It explores customer demographics and purchase behavior based on gender, age group, occupation, city category, and product categories.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Dataset**: `Diwali Sales Data.csv`
- **Tools Used**:  
  - `Pandas` for data cleaning and manipulation  
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` for visualization  
  - `Jupyter Notebook` for interactive exploration

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full code and analysis
- `Diwali Sales Data.csv` – Dataset used for this project 

## 📊 Key Insights

- Which gender and age group contributes the most to sales
- Top 10 product categories by total sales
- Which states and cities have the highest spending
- Occupation-wise and marital status-based purchase behavior

## 📌 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed raw data
- Created multiple visualizations like bar plots, count plots, histograms
- Summarized total sales per group using `groupby()` and sorting
- Labeled bars using `bar_label` for better clarity

## 💡 Skills Applied

- Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
- Data Aggregation with `groupby()`
- Visualization Best Practices (titles, labels, legends, annotation)
- Markdown documentation in Jupyter Notebook

## 📝 Learnings
- Performed Data cleaning and manipulation
- Performed `Exploratory Data Analysis`(EDA) using pandas,seaborn and matplotlib libraries
- Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states,occupation,gender and age groups
- Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands 


## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
3. Run each cell in order to replicate the analysis

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Build an interactive dashboard (using Plotly/Dash)
- Use advanced analytics (e.g., clustering by customer type)
- Turn into a web app using Streamlit
